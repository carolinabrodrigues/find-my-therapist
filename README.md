# The Product

Find My Therapist is an innovative matchmaking application designed to help you find the perfect therapist based on three essential factors: therapy setup (online or in-person), psychological approach, and price per session. Our goal is to streamline the process of finding a therapist that fits your unique needs and preferences.

**How it works:**
1. **Browse Therapist Profiles:** Begin by exploring detailed profiles of therapists in your area or available online. Each profile includes information about the therapist’s psychological approach, availability, and session rates.
2. **Express Interest:** If a therapist catches your eye, simply show your interest. If not, continue browsing until you find a suitable match.
3. **Therapist Reviews Client Profiles:** Therapists receive notifications when a potential client shows interest. They can then review the client’s profile to ensure a good fit.
4. **Mutual Agreement:** If the therapist believes they can help, they will accept the client. If not, they may decline, allowing the client to continue their search.
5. **Schedule a Session:** Once both the client and therapist agree to proceed, the therapist’s calendar link becomes available. The client can then schedule their first session and begin their therapeutic journey.
